As public funding falls short and classroom needs grow, families—especially those on the margins—are being left behind. Together, we can change that.</p><p>All proceeds from this event will go directly toward buying backpacks, notebooks, pencils, and essential learning tools for local students who need them most.</p><p><strong>No experience necessary!</strong> Whether you’re a seasoned pickleball pro or picking up a paddle for the first time, everyone is welcome to play and support our schools. Register today, rally your friends, and let’s help give every child the tools they need to learn, dream, and thrive.</p><p>Don’t feel like competing? You can still make a difference by sending donations of any amount to <strong>@wozarnold</strong> on Venmo—every dollar helps equip our kids for success.</p>"
